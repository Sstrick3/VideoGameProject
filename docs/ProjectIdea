Project Idea
Samuel Strickland

	My project idea is creating a video game, I am not sure exactly what kind, but I do want it to be created in Unity and have some sort of a management feel to it, whether it is an RPG or a tycoon I have not decided. I do know that I want it to involve money and a form of a shop and maybe an upgrade system.
 I would not say that this game will fix any sort of problem but the people who will benefit people who are bored and or just looking for some sort of entertainment. I am attempting this project because I want to enhance my skills in creating video games. An outsider needs to understand that creating video games is not an easy task, and it is even more difficult for someone who is attempting it by themselves with not much experience. I am going to create it using Unity and will most likely have to watch a series of tutorials on how to go about the actual creation of the game.
 I will constitute a successful project if it looks good and functions as it is supposed to. Minimal to no bugs is the desired outcome, but that is a bridge we will cross when we get there. I really hope to get more experience and knowledge of unity to where I can even show and teach my friends who are interested in doing some of what we do.
